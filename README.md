**Warning:** this bot is currently under active development. We are not responsible for any issues that may arise from the use of any portion of the here-above code

### About
This bot serves multiple purposes on our Discord server.
Its two main functions are:
- assign roles, authorisations, nicknames etc. based on website account, VATSIM membership, or live VATSIM datafeeds;
- deliver information that may be needed or required for members of our community.

The bot is live 24/7/365 and has a direct uplink to the website database. Therefore, the privacy policy of the website and the French vACC's webservices applies to this bot, by extension.
